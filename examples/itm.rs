//! Sends "Hello, world!" through the ITM port 0
//!
//! ITM is much faster than semihosting. Like 4 orders of magnitude or so.
//!
//! **NOTE** Cortex-M0 chips don't support ITM.
//!
//! You'll have to connect the microcontroller's SWO pin to the SWD interface. Note that some
//! development boards don't provide this option.
//!
//! You'll need [`itmdump`] to receive the message on the host plus you'll need to uncomment two
//! `monitor` commands in the `.gdbinit` file.
