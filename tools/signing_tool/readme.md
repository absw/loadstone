# Image Signing Tool

This tool appends an ECDSA/SHA256 signature to a file.

For usage help do `signing_tool --help`.

The program expects a PKCS8 private key, such as ones generated by doing `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -m PKCS8` for example.

## Building

To build the tool (required rust installation), do `cargo build --release`.
